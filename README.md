# Budget-Tracker
A helpful budget tracker written in Python.

Note that there are currently three branches.

The master branch is reserved for safe modifications, so it will be a little behind the other branches.

The oopfeature branch is for adjusting the budget tracker to a Python class system, as opposed to a dictionary-based system. Since this is a dramatic overhaul of the budget tracker, it will not be merged into the master branch until it is functioning at the current level of the master branch.

The desktop-version branch is for a desktop-specific implementation of the budget tracker. While the long-term goal is to make this a web app, having a lightweight budget tracker local to a given machine is useful, so long as the user knows Python. While not as user-friendly as a web app, it allows for greater customization.
